This is an app to visualize the working of various sorting algorithms. We can vary the length of the array being sorted.

This is created using NextJS and is a pretty straightforward application.

All algorithms are implemented to sort the array in a sort-of inplace manner. The algorithms used can be found in app/lib/array.tsx
The components used are minimal, we have reused a single bar chart component to render all algorithms. The components can be found under app/ui/components

## Getting Started
To get the application running locally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
